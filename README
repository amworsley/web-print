Simple web base printing page based on python CGI and static HTML referencing page

  upload.py - python CGI script for uploading a file to /scratch2 directory
  print.py - python CGI script for printing to the default printer using lpr command
       handles an optional rotate button to use pdf90 to rotate the pdf before printing.
  upload.html - HTML front end that references upload.py for uploading a file
  print.html - HTML front end that invokes print.py for printing

Presently need a directory /scratch that is owned by www-daemon so it can write the
uploaded files to it.
